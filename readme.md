# Hackspace-Bots

Below is the information for the build of the Hackspace-Bots project

---

## Objective:

The Hackspace-Bots project aims to create a Small 3 wheeled robot that is capable of being controlled using a bluetooth interface.

---

## Components:

The project requires a combination of hardware and software components

You will need:

[Raspberry Pi Pico W][1]

[Stepper motor controller][2]

[2 x Motors and wheels][3]

[18650 Battery and Charger][4]

[2x 18650 holder][5]


Connector Board and Wires (Schematics for this board will be available once they are finished)

A basic understanding of micro-python.

And perhaps most importantly an imagination

---
During this project we aim to produce a step-by-step guide to building your very own hackspace bot! 

** Join the Hackspace-Bots project and dive into the exciting world of robotics within a collaborative and innovative community! **

First off, you'll need to put micropython on your PicoW you can follow the instructions [here][6].

Once that's done you'll need [Thonny][7] so go ahead and download, then install it.

Running thonny, go to the top and the `Run >  Configure Interpreter` option, in the _port_ option select
`Try to detect automatically` and click OK

We're not ready to select our adventure:
